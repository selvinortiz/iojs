# IO.JS
This is an *experimental* javascript toolkit written for cross browser **event** handling, **DOM** selection, and **XHR**.

## Objective
The goal was to create a super *lightweight* version of **jQuery** by exploring the way it does things and to borrow some of its concepts.

The web is littered with javascript libraries and we all or most of us use them on real projects on a daily basis.
The reason I created **IO.JS** was to play with the more intimate details about browser compatibility issues.
The other (*more important*) reason being that I am currently working on a project where we are not using external libraries.

`more to come...`
